In the /data directory, there's a file named fishy.log, which contains the system log. Log entries are written in this format:

Month Day hour:minute:second mycomputername "process_name"["random 5 digit number"] "ERROR/INFO/WARN" "Error description"


Introduction

Imagine one of your colleagues is struggling with a program that keeps throwing an error. Unfortunately,
the program's source code is too complicated to easily find the error there.
The good news is that the program outputs a log file you can read! Let's write a script to search the
log file for the exact error, then output that error into a separate file so you can work out what's wrong.

What you'll do

Write a script to search the log file using regex to find for the exact error.
Report the error into a separate file so you know what's wrong for further analysis.
You'll have 90 minutes to complete this lab.


EXECUTION STEPS
======================

sudo chmod +x find_error.py


./find_error.py ~/data/fishy.log


#This script will now prompt for the type of error to be searched. Continue by entering the following type of error:
#BELOW WE NEED TO ENTER FOR INPUT FUNCTION
CRON ERROR Failed to start

#On successful execution, this will generate an errors_found.log file, where you will find all the ERROR logs based on your search.
You can view the ERROR log using the command below:

cat ~/data/errors_found.log
